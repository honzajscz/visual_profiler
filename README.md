## Abstract
The performance profiling is a powerful way how to get a valuable insight into software applications. In order to be precise and efective, a performance profiler needs to run with low performance and memory overhead and present the result in a transparent way to a developer. In this thesis we analyze performance profiling in the context of Microsoft .NET platform, with focus on the C# programming language, and introduce our own implementation of a profiler, the Visual Profiler. The Visual Profiler features tracing and sampling profiling engines together with an innovative way of presenting the profiling results within the integrated development environment Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.
